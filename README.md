# Name

Exchange Rate of currency.

# Description

To implement a REST service to display exchange rates for our
customers. The service receives three parameters: two currencies and a date using the
URL path. The format of the URL path is

/api/exchange-rate/{date}/{baseCurrency}/{targetCurrency}

The REST service returns:
1. The exchange rate of the requested date.
2. The average of the five days before the requested date (excluding Saturday and
Sunday ) and the exchange rate trend.

The exchange rate trend is determined using following definition:
 . Descending: when the exchange rates in the last five days are in strictly descending order.
 . Ascending:  when the exchange rates in the last five days are in strictly ascending order
 . Constant:   when the exchange rates in the last five days are the same
 . Undefined:  In other cases.

Basic Features

 . Allow users to query the exchange rate using two currencies and a date using the API.
 . Only dates between 2000-01-01 and yesterday are allowed. 
 The API of https://exchangeratesapi.io/ should be used as data source to implement our REST service. 
 Only the currencies supported by https://exchangeratesapi.io/ can be used.

Return an error in case of incorrect input parameters the error should be returned using the format of http://jsonapi.org (status, title
and description are required, other fields are optional)

All successful queries should be persisted in the DB. 
The customer can get historical information using two APIâ€™s, one for the daily information and other for the monthly information.
. daily: /api/exchange-rate/history/daily/{yyyy}/{MM}/{dd}
. monthly: /api/exchange-rate/history/monthly/{yyyy}/{MM}

## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:
JDK 1.8
Maven 3

## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the com.exchange.rates.RatesApplication class from your IDE.
Alternatively you can use below command [more information see](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins.html#build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin) .

```

## Usage

```python
Spring Security will ask to to enter UserName & Password
User Name: admin
Password: password

To see Data in browser go to http://localhost:8085/h2-console

API document is written in swagger 
please go to http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui.html#/

How to Dockerize Spring Boot Application
Go to docker console inside project target directory run the following command 

Build Docker Image
$ docker build -t rates.jar .

Check Docker Image
$ docker image ls

Run Docker Image
$ docker run -p 9090:8085 rates.jar

In the run command, we have specified that the port 8085 on the container should be mapped to the port 9090 on the Host OS.
```
